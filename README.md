OpenGL / GLSL in Qt Project as demonstration for student classes

This project is supposed to be easily understandable in terms of programming and hopefully enables CG students to dive into OpenGL and GLSL programming without thinking of operation system sepcifics. 

It also shows some Qt stuff like:
- MainWindow actions
- use of QSettings
- dynamic widget creation
- use of C++11 lambdas in signal-slot connections

** Currently work in progress **
